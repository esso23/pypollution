[map-gen-preset-description]
pyanodon-default=Default settings to play Pyanodon's suite. Pollution and Time evolution factors are reduced. This is still enough to give you a hard time if you do not use effective processing.
pyanodon-easy=Zero time factor gives you enough time to play around and low pollution factor allows to go for less effective production chains without consequences. Intended for beginners and those who don't have experience with harder Factorio mods.
pyanodon-hard=For those looking for a challenge.
pyanodon-rail-world=Rail World. This will not work well with RSO.
