[map-gen-preset-description]
pyanodon-default=Default settings to play Pyanodon's suite. Pollution and Time evolution factors are reduced. This is still enough to give you a hard time if you do not use optimal processing.
pyanodon-easy=Zero time factor gives you enough time to play around and low pollution factor allows to go for less optimal production chains without consequences. Intended for beginners and those who don't have experience with harder Factorio mods.
pyanodon-hard=If you like to use the most optimal processes and have some experience with pY suite, this is an ideal difficulty for you.
