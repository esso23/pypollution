Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2020.03.03
  Info:
    - Added full support for pyAlienLife
  Changes:
    - Rebalanced pollution on factories
    - Most factories have had their pollution/min. reduced
    - Some pollution-absorbing buildings now absorb less
    - Early game mandatory buildings now have much lower pollution/min. (like Destructive Distillation Column) to make pyAL start possible
    - Map presets modified to work better in pyAlienLife (some settings are different when pyAlienLife is not installed)
    - Solar Panels are now much more expensive and take much longer to craft to compensate for their high value in long games
