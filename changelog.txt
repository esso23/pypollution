Version: 0.4.2
Date: 2020.07.15
  Changes:
    - Reducing crafting cost of Compost Plants (MK1 - MK4) to 50% of the original amount
    - Reduding duration of compost recipes to 10 seconds (30 seconds was way too high considering the size of the building)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.1
Date: 2020.07.14
  Changes:
    - Reducing Biomass' pollution from 110% to 105% (equal to Raw Coal)
    - Compost Plant's pollution per minute remains the same at all MKs (as opposed to other buildings for which it increases) and has been reduced from 10/m to 5/m
    - Compost Plant's energy consumption has been significantly reduced (down from ~413kW to 50kW at MK01)
    - Increased duration of all composting recipes to 30 seconds (up from 6 seconds in v0.4.0 and 3 seconds default)
    - Ethanol can now be used as fuel
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.0
Date: 2020.07.12
  Changes:
    - Nerfing Biomass which is stupidly strong as a fuel and can be made from basically anything
    - Biomass now pollutes 10% (slightly more than Raw Coal) more and has 2MJ fuel value (down from 4MJ)
    - Compost Plants now generate more pollution
    - All Biomass recipes now take longer to craft (composting takes time, right?)
    - Crafting Biomass from Oil products is now significantly less effective (why is it even possible?)
    - Some recipes like Sap/Wood/Logs/Moss/Seaweed (easily obtainable stuff) to Biomass have been nerfed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.4
Date: 2020.04.04
  Bugfix:
    - Mod compatibility fix
  Changes:
    - Glassworks' energy consumption reduced to 1MW (from 27MW) - this fix is enabled by default and can be disabled in mod settings
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.3
Date: 2020.03.24
  Changes:
    - Modified some void recipes to generate 0 pollution: Purest Nitrogen Gas, Alien Bacteria, Phytoplankton, Xyhiphoe Blood, Cold Air, Cold Clean Air, Liquid Nitrogen & Arthropod Blood
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.2
Date: 2020.03.16
  Changes:

    - Reduced Sap Extractor's pollution absorption from -10/m to -5/m (pyAL only)
    - Reduced Moondrop Greenhouse's pollution absorption from -25/m to -20/m (pyAL only)
    - Reduced Moss Farm's pollution absorption from -20/m to -15/m (pyAL only)
    - Reduced Seaweed Crop Plantation's pollution absorption from -20/m to -10/m (pyAL only)
    - Reduced Atomizer's pollution generation from 10/m to 4/m (pyAL only)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.1
Date: 2020.03.09
  Changes:
    - Log recipes no longer scale their absorption modifier with recipe quality
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2020.03.03
  Info:
    - Added full support for pyAlienLife
  Changes:
    - Rebalanced pollution on factories
    - Most factories have had their pollution/min. reduced
    - Some pollution-absorbing buildings now absorb less
    - Early game mandatory buildings now have much lower pollution/min. (like Destructive Distillation Column) to make pyAL start possible
    - Map presets modified to work better in pyAlienLife (some settings are different when pyAlienLife is not installed)
    - Solar Panels are now much more expensive and take much longer to craft to compensate for their high value in long games
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Changes:
    - Reduced fuel pollution on Raw Coal (Coal has been removed in latest version of pyRawOres)
